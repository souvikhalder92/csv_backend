The Halal Guys legend began in 1990, when the three founding partners opened up a hot dog cart on West 53rd &amp; 6th Avenue in New York City. As business grew, they recognized a huge demand from Muslim cab drivers looking for a halal food meal. That is when the famous platter of chicken and gyro over rice was born. And let's not forget about the famous white and red sauces! Fast-forward 25 years, five carts, two New York City restaurants, and millions of diverse customers served, The Halal Guys is growing yet again.

The Halal Guys legend began in 1990, when the three founding partners opened up a hot dog cart on West 53rd &amp; 6th Avenue in New York City. As business grew, they recognized a huge demand from Muslim cab drivers looking for a halal food meal. That is when the famous platter of chicken and gyro over rice was born. And let's not forget about the famous white and red sauces! Fast-forward 25 years, five carts, two New York City restaurants, and millions of diverse customers served, The Halal Guys is growing yet again.

He partnered with his son, Anthony Sarago, on the project and Hot Chikn Kitchn began to form. Putting together a team was the next step. With the goal in mind to create a concept that represented unity, the Saragos found the missing business partner in Chef Frederic Gilmore. Together they proved during trying times that all people, from all walks of life, no matter what background can be united through food.
